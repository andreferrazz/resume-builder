# Resume Builder

A simple resume builder.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab:

```sh
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
